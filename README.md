# Natural Gas Trading
A natural gas and petroleum futures trading app. It scrapes an inventory report from the website at the moment of its release and trades based on the difference with the forecast. The app is designed to run on multilple computers that send data from one another.

I wrote it in 2012-2013.

I was able to make some money with it, but it was tough because my network connections were too slow.

This is a new version that is not fully finished. I didn't include some files.
