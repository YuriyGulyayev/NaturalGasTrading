# Natural Gas Trading

A natural gas and petroleum futures trading app. It scrapes an inventory report from a government agency website at the moment of its release and trades based on the difference with the forecast. Multiple instances of the app run on multiple computers. The instance that receives the report faster will take action. The instances send data among each other.

I was able to make some money with it, but it was tough because my network connections were too slow.

I wrote it in 2012-2013.

This is a new version that is not fully finished. I didn't include some files.
